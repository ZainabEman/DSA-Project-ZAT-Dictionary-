# ZAT Dictionary

The ZAT Dictionary is a comprehensive C++ project that leverages the trie data structure to create a powerful and efficient tool for managing and exploring word meanings. This project is built on three key classes: Node, Trie, and Vector, working collaboratively to form a feature-rich dictionary capable of fast and reliable access to information.

## Project Structure

### Node Class
- **Building block** for linked lists within the dictionary.
- **Holds character values** and pointers to the next node.
- **Facilitates** the creation of dynamic data structures.

### Trie Class
- **Heart of the dictionary**, implementing a trie data structure.
- **Hierarchical structure** with each node having up to 26 children for efficient storage and retrieval.
- **Enables quick and organized representation** of the entire dictionary.

### Vector Class
- **Manages dynamic arrays**, ensuring flexibility in data size and storage.
- **Contributes to the adaptability** of the overall dictionary implementation.

## Initialization and Data Loading
- The dictionary is **initialized by reading data** from an external text file containing a pre-existing set of words and their meanings.
- This initial dataset **populates the dictionary**, setting the stage for efficient word management.

## Main Interface
- **Serves as a gateway** for users to interact with the dictionary.
- Offers operations such as **search, update, delete, add word**, and **team details**.
- The trie structure ensures **optimal efficiency** in these operations.

## Main Features

### GUI
- **User-friendly interface** designed for a visually intuitive experience.
- **Interactive operations** allow users to search for meanings, add new words, and delete entries with ease.

### Exception Handling
- **Precise error messages** aid in quick issue resolution.
- **Improved debugging** through explicit exception handling for identifying and addressing issues efficiently.

## Working

### Search Function and Suggestions
- **User-friendly main screen** with search functionality and suggestions.

### Adding Word
- **Top ten suggestions** provided during word addition.

### Update Function
- **Confirmation screen** appears after entering an update, ensuring a successful word update.

### Delete Function
- **Confirmation screen** appears after entering a delete operation, ensuring a successful word deletion.

### Add Word Function
- **Confirmation screen** appears after entering an add word operation, ensuring successful addition.

### Exit Function
- **Team details** accessible from the main menu, providing a smooth exit from the application.

## Conclusion
The ZAT Dictionary showcases the fusion of linked lists, trie structures, and dynamic arrays to create a robust and adaptable solution for word management. The trie structure's efficiency in organizing extensive word data makes this dictionary a valuable tool for both users and developers. Explore meanings, update entries, and manage your words effortlessly with the ZAT Dictionary.
